        Analysing Salaries of Undergraduate Majors
      </h1>
      <p id = backgroundInformationQuestion>
        You always hear jokes about the cost of college and student loan debt. Which makes sense considering how 15% of all american adults claim they still have student loan debt ( 
        <a href="https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics#:~:text=While%20total%20student%20loan%20debt,report%20outstanding%20postgraduate%20student%20loans." target="_blank">Click Here to See Article</a>
        ). So, to help alleviate the stress of student loans, I found the best undergraduate majors (at least from a profit based view point) by answering the question, which five undergraduate majors allow for the highest, starting median revenue when entering the work force? 
      </p>
      <p2 id = dataCollectionProcess>
        I began by finding a table on Kaggle titled, Where it Pays to Attend College, in which undergraduate majors and their median starting revenues were given amongst other information. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn I was able to clean the data, find the quartiles of the revenues, and make a bar graph containing the five highest revenues.

        The bar graph is used to represent the data as that data's categorical, meaning it could be separated/grouped by a qualitative characteristic (in this case, undergraduate majors), which is best shown using a bar graph. Along with that, the quartiles were used to show the skewing of the data, with the difference of the upper quartile and middle quartile being greater than the difference of the middle quartile and lower quartile showing that the revenue skews upward. Meaning the top five revenues are the exceptions, not the rule, and therefore the majors will have a distinct increase in revenue from the rest of the majors (something also seen in the histogram below), showing how they're going to be objectively better (at least financially speaking).

      <br>
      <p4 id = results>
        According to the bar graph above, we can see that the top five most profitable undergraduate majors when entering into the workforce are physician assistant, chemical engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Meaning that if you want to have the best revenue and best chance of getting out of debt after getting your undergraduate major, choose one of those five majors.  
      </p4>

      <p5 id = methodologyP2>
        One threat to validity is that the Kaggle table got its data from a table on The Wall Street Journal, with the description of the table on The Wall Street Journal's page being that the data was collected through a year-long survey of 1.2 million people by PayScale Inc. with there than being no other information about the survey. In other words, I don't know the specifics of the survey (nor can I find them), leading to the survey being unreliable, and therefore the results not being credible. Along with that, an article entitled, List of College Majors (
      <a href="https://www.mymajors.com/college-majors/" target="_blank">Click Here to See the Page</a>
        ), claims that there could possibly be 1,800 unique majors, meaning my data set of 50 unique majors has too little data and my results could be different if I had the starting median revenue of every or the majority of undergraduate majors. To go further, the credibility of the results can also be questioned by there being many factors for getting a job that pays well other than an undergraduate major, including other degrees/education, the college itself, the economy, other aspects of your resume, and etc.
