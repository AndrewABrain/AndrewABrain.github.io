      <p style="color:white">
        As the amount of people and popularity on and of social media rises, we can see that people's ten 
        minutes of fame are becoming more than a once in a lifetime occurrence. Leading to the wandering of whether there’s a way 
        to artificially become more influential or popular online. Or in other words, is there a positive, statistically 
        significant correlation between the number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, or number of posts an 
        influencer has and their influence score? I approached answering this question through using a data table found on Kaggle 
        (Top Influencers Crushing On Instagram), which contained a lot of data about Instagramers, including their influence 
        score, number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, and number of posts (which are the five stats used 
        for this analysis). After some data wrangling and analysis, I graphed the relationships between influence score and 
        number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, and number of posts. With this showing that the number of followers have a positive correlation to influence score, 
        whilst the average likes, total likes, and number of posts have a negative correlation to influence score. We can interpret these trends to mean that the best way
        to increase influence score is through increasing followers, whilst avoiding posting or getting likes. However, none of these trends or conclusions
        are valid, as the table under the graphs show that all Pearson Correlation Coefficients between data aren’t higher than 
        the threshold of 0.5 (with the highest being the 0.365428 correlation between followers and influencer score), and 
        therefore the data isn’t correlated enough for a statistically legitimate trend to be seen. On further analysis of the other data in Kaggle's data sheet, I found that rank of influencer could
        be a variable the influences the influence score (with the higher the rank leading to a higher score). At the end of the day, number of followers and rank are most 
        likely to positively correlate with influence score, but I need more conclusive data.
