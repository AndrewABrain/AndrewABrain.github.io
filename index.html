        Analysing Salaries of Undergraduate Majors
      </h1>
      <p id = backgroundInformationQuestion>
        Through out your entire life, you are essentially asked, what do you want your future to be? With the chances of someone reaching their ideal future releying on the classes and degrees they get in college. So to help reach your desired future, I found the best underraduate majors (atleast from a profit based veiw point) by answering the question, which five undergraduate majors allow for the highest, starting median revenue when entering the job force? 
      </p>
      <p2 id = dataCollectionProcess>
        I began by finding a table on Kaggle titled, Where it Pays to Attend College, in which undergraduate majors and there median starting revenues were given amongst other infromation. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn I was able to clean the data, find the quantiles of the revenues, and make a bar graph containing the five highest paying revenues.
