  <p style="color:white">As the amount of people and popularity on and of social media rises, we can see that people's ten 
    minutes of fame are becoming more than a once in a lifetime occurrence. Leading to the wandering of whether there’s a way 
    to artificially become more influential or popular online. Or in other words, is there a positive, statistically 
    significant correlation between the number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, or number of posts an 
    influencer has and their influence score? I approached answering this question through using a data table found on Kaggle 
    (Top Influencers Crushing On Instagram), which contained a lot of data about Instagramers, including their influence 
    score, number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, and number of posts (which are the five stats used 
    for this analysis). After some data wrangling and analysis, we can graph the relationships between influence score and 
    number of followers, average likes, total number of likes, and number of posts. With the number of followers and posts 
    having a positive correlation to influence score, while the average likes and total likes have a negative correlation 
    to influence score. We can interpret these trends to mean that the best way to increase influence score is through 
    increasing followers and posts, whilst avoiding high total or average likes. However, none of these trends or conclusions 
    are valid, as the table under the graphs show that all Pearson Coefficient Correlations between data aren’t higher than 
    the threshold of 0.5 (with the highest being the 0.442241 correlation between followers and influencer score), and 
    therefore the data isn’t correlated enough for a statistically, legitimate trend to be seen.</p>
